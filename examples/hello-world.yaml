# Simple hello-world example - triggers Claude with any incoming message
id: hello-world

description: |
  A minimal example that passes any incoming webhook payload to Claude.
  Great for testing and learning how spriteswarm works.

  To test, send a POST request:
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/webhook/generic \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-Webhook-Secret: your-secret" \
      -d '{"message": "Hello, Claude!"}'

  Set GENERIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-secret in your environment.

sprite:
  name: hello-agent
  path: claude
  cmd: "-p"
  workdir: /home/user

source:
  type: generic
  events:
    - message

run: |
  You received a message from a user. Respond helpfully.

  Message: {{payload.message}}

  If the message is empty or unclear, just say hello and explain what you can help with.
