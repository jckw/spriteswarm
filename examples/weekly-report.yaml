  It's Friday - time to write the weekly engineering summary.

  1. Use the GitHub API to gather this week's activity:
     - PRs merged (with brief descriptions)
     - Issues closed
     - New issues opened
     - Any incidents or hotfixes

  2. Write a summary for non-technical stakeholders:
     - What shipped this week (in plain English)
     - What's in progress
     - Any blockers or risks
     - What's planned for next week

  3. Post to #engineering-updates in Slack
  4. Also save to reports/week-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
