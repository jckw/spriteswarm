  Good morning! Time for the daily metrics check.

  1. Query PostHog API for the last 24 hours:
     - Daily active users
     - Signup → activation → paid conversion rates
     - Top 5 events by volume
     - Any events with >20% drop vs last week

  2. Analyze what you find:
     - What's the most important thing the team should know?
     - Any anomalies or concerns?
     - One specific, actionable recommendation

  3. Post a concise summary to #metrics in Slack
     - Lead with the key insight, not raw numbers
     - Keep it under 200 words
     - Use :warning: only if something needs immediate attention
