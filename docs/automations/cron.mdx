title: Cron Schedules
description: 'Run automations on a schedule'
---

Cron automations run on a schedule instead of waiting for webhooks. Perfect for daily reports, periodic checks, and recurring tasks.

## Configuration

```yaml
source:
  type: cron
  schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5"  # 9am weekdays
```

## Cron Expression Format

```
┌────────── minute (0-59)
│ ┌──────── hour (0-23)
│ │ ┌────── day of month (1-31)
│ │ │ ┌──── month (1-12)
│ │ │ │ ┌── day of week (0-7, 0 and 7 are Sunday)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

## Common Patterns

| Expression | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `0 9 * * *` | Every day at 9am |
| `0 9 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 9am |
| `0 16 * * 5` | Fridays at 4pm |
| `0 0 * * *` | Midnight daily |
| `*/15 * * * *` | Every 15 minutes |
| `0 */2 * * *` | Every 2 hours |
| `0 0 1 * *` | First of each month |
| `0 9 * * 1` | Mondays at 9am |

## Examples

### Daily Report

```yaml
id: daily-metrics
source:
  type: cron
  schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5"
sprite:
  name: analytics-agent
run: Generate daily metrics report and post to Slack.
```

### Weekly Summary

```yaml
id: weekly-summary
source:
  type: cron
  schedule: "0 16 * * 5"
sprite:
  name: reporting-agent
run: Create weekly engineering summary for #team channel.
```

### Hourly Health Check

```yaml
id: health-check
source:
  type: cron
  schedule: "0 * * * *"
sprite:
  name: ops-agent
run: Check system health. Alert if issues found.
```

## Timezone

Cron schedules run in the server's timezone (UTC by default on Fly.io). Adjust your expressions accordingly.

<Tip>
For 9am Pacific (PST/PDT), use `0 17 * * *` (UTC) or `0 16 * * *` (during daylight saving).
</Tip>

## No Payload

Cron automations don't have a `payload`—there's no incoming event data. Template variables like `{{payload.x}}` won't work.

You can still use `{{sprite.workdir}}` and hard-coded values in your command.
