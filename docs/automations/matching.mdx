title: Match Conditions
description: 'Filter which events trigger your automations'
---

The `match` field filters incoming events. Only events matching all conditions will trigger the automation.

## Syntax

```yaml
match:
  - payload.field == "value"
  - payload.nested.field == "other"
```

Each condition is a JSONPath equality expression.

## Rules

- **All conditions must pass** (AND logic)
- **Empty match = matches everything**
- Supports **strings**, **numbers**, and **booleans**
- Access nested fields with **dot notation**
- Access array elements with **bracket notation**

## Examples

### Match by Action

```yaml
match:
  - payload.action == "opened"
```

### Multiple Conditions

```yaml
match:
  - payload.action == "opened"
  - payload.pull_request.draft == false
  - payload.pull_request.base.ref == "main"
```

### Nested Fields

```yaml
match:
  - payload.data.issue.level == "error"
  - payload.data.issue.project.slug == "backend"
```

### Array Elements

```yaml
match:
  - payload.issue.labels[0].name == "bug"
```

### Boolean Values

```yaml
match:
  - payload.pull_request.merged == true
```

### Numeric Values

```yaml
match:
  - payload.data.object.amount == 4900
```

## Common Patterns

### GitHub PR to Main

```yaml
match:
  - payload.action == "opened"
  - payload.pull_request.base.ref == "main"
  - payload.pull_request.draft == false
```

### Sentry Errors Only

```yaml
match:
  - payload.action == "created"
  - payload.data.issue.level == "error"
```

### Slack App Mentions

```yaml
match:
  - payload.event.type == "app_mention"
```

### Stripe Subscription Events

```yaml
match:
  - payload.data.object.status == "canceled"
```

## No Match Field

If you omit the `match` field entirely, the automation matches all events of the specified type:

```yaml
source:
  type: webhook
  event: push

# No match field = triggers on ALL push events
run: Handle the push...
```

## Limitations

- **Equality only**: No `>`, `<`, `!=`, or regex
- **AND logic only**: No OR conditions
- **No functions**: Can't call functions on values
- **Case-sensitive**: String matching is exact

For complex filtering, handle the logic in your Sprite's command.
